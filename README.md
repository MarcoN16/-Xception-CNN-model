# Xception-CNN-model

In this activity, I used the pretrained `Xception` CNN model to predict image labels.

## Instructions

* Visit the [Xception](https://keras.io/applications/#xception) documentation to determine the image size and any other parameters needed to load and use the model.

* Preprocessing the test image by using the model's `preprocess_input` function.

* Using the trained model to predict the output label for the [puppy image](Images/pup.jpg).

### Second part

* Refactoring the code into a reusable function that accepts an input image and returns a preprocessed image.

* Testing the code by preprocessing the image of a [kitten](Images/kitten.jpg) and printing the predicted labels.
